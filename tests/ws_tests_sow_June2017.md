# Statement of Work

Develop an automated test suite covering the current set of 20 Phylotastic services. The tests will be written in Python and will use an existing test framework (e.g., see https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy). For each service, include tests of all examples in the documentation (typically 1 to 3), along with X other tests.  Any new methods or functions in the test suite will be documented inline using an existing standard. The test code will use an open-source license and will be developed in a new or existing github repository associated with the Phylotastic project. 

Tests will probe (1) whether the API is correctly described in the docs, (2) what happens with edge cases, input range limits, and error-generating conditions such as syntax errors that may be expected to arise deliberately or accidentally in normal use.  Examples of edge cases would be things like querying for a tree with a list of extinct species, or querying with a taxon name that is uncharacteristically long or complex. Testing for range limits is typically going to involve finding (within a factor of 2) the minimum query complexity (e.g., number of taxa) that results in an error or an unacceptable delay (> 15 sec with no feedback or warning of delays). 

The work will be performed by THE CONSULTANT remotely, and completed by July 14, 2017.  The task will be considered completed when it is possible to download and execute a test suite meeting the above criteria.
