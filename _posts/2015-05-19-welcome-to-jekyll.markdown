Starting Phylotastic repo blog with this post. This blog allows to use
`markdown` and synthax highliting. It uses [Jekyll][jekyll] which stands in
between of static and dynamic pages. I am creating this post as a simple 
text file and I would be able to use Jekyll's macros, if I would want to.

I expect @arlin will change this post to something more profound.
