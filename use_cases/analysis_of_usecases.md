use case analysis 

to do
* find my relative service 
   * taxon t, number n, rank r: return up to n species in taxon rank r of taxon t
* endangered service 
* link thumbnail to larger image

1. 10 genera

we can generate live image.  better would be to save clickable version to share with students.  


2. flora of the parks 

* web site scrape did not work due to dynamic content
* text copy and paste did not work for unknown reasons
* sent file directly to GNRD, then saved output, and this worked, minus a few species 

3. endangered species 

tree of the endangered

need exploration capability (find my relative) to include non-endangered relatives.  

need distribution data 

* see "find my relative" service 

4. summary phylogenies 

our work-around is make our own list of taxonomic names 

other lower-tech workaround.  

   1. google to get list of higher taxa (Sauropsida, Aves)
   2. use portal to sample 10 species from each taxon 
   3. combine the lists 

5. integrate additional data

here is what we can provide now
* EOL link
* thumbnail image

here is what we could provide 
* habitat (from EOL)
* endangered status (redlist), possibly via EOL
* some range info from EOL
* size
* fossil data (PaleoDB)

can't provide
* toxicity
* pathogenicity
* medicinal value

6.  natural language (priority 2)

wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_of_Papua_New_Guinea

bug: didn't work through portal. 

went to gnrd, got list of over 900.  loaded list, got tree.  

Includes "Victoria" (genus) giant water lily instead of "Victoria crowned pigeon, Goura victoria"

* needed: restrict input to focal clade
