## List of necessary features 

### Priority 1
   * Provide visualisation of phylogenetic trees
      * Viewer requirements
         * zoom
         * re-order clades
         * collapse/expand nodes
   * Provide phylogenetic trees in common formats
   * Incorporate branch lengths
      * Calibrate with fossils
   * Provide different types of metadata on tips
      * images (thumbnails on tips)
      * EOL/Wiki (clickable) (link )
      * biogeographic (phylogeographic) information (eg. GBIF, iNaturalist)
   * Provide references for all steps
      * Examples
         * Electronic source = OT
            * sources which OT uses for support
         * Date accessed
         * web service used (eg. NMSU GET subtree)       
   * Report name matches
      * map user inputs to matched name (eg. 'Bonobo' = _Pan paniscus_)
      * map matched names to synonyms
      * map matched names to authority
   * Ability to scrape names from manuscripts, species lists, URLs
      * ability to constrict these data by
         * Nomenclatural Codes (ICN, ICNP, ICZN)
         * Focal clades (eg. Asteraceae)
   * Ability to construct trees of Orders, Families, Genera besides just species

    
### Priority 2
   * Provide different types of metadata on tips
      * Fossil data (eg. paleodb, paleobase)
      * conservation status (RedLists)
      * habitat (eg. EOL)
   * Demonstrate tips that are supported by molecular data compared to only taxonomy
   * Support common names for
      * input
      * display
   * Ability to sample out from a node to show phylogenetic context (eg. 'rabbit' -> receive a tree with rabbit and friends)
   * Ability to sample out from 'n' nodes to show phylogenetic context
      * n = 1...6


### Priority 3 
   * Provide different types of metadata on tips
      * Toxicity (eg. http://ucanr.edu/sites/poisonous_safe_plants/Toxic_Plants_by_Scientific_Name_685/)
      * Pathogenicity (eg. http://www.life.umd.edu/classroom/bsci424/pathogendescriptions/PathogenList.htm; http://www.bode-science-center.com/center/relevant-pathogens-from-a-z.html)
      * medicinal value (eg. https://www.odishafdc.com/products_medicinal_plants.php)
      * size (eg. EOL)
      * sitings
   * Provide a version customised for use by children
   * Provide examples of monophyletic, paraphyletic, and polyphyletic taxa. 
   * Include the ability to demonstrate the evolution of character data and display reconstructions
