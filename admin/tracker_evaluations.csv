This is a polished, capable, mature product, not buggy. Some aspects are a bit hard to figure out. "waffle,Arlin,yes,built in,,yes,,Can't seem to make milestones or sprints across repos.  centraldesktop,Thanh,No,No,99$,It does not support repos, http://comparisons.financesonline.com/zoho-projects-vs-central-desktop,More reference : http://comparisons.financesonline.com/zoho-projects-vs-central-desktopzenhub,Dima,yes,,,yes,,Dima wrote quite a bit about this.  See his comments at : https://waffle.io/phylotastic/phylotastic/cards/56328b4f6ccd262500a2528brally,Dima,,,"Rally is free to a point, so if team grows beyond that point -- it stops being free. They do have someone who contacted me personally when they saw that I registered there. They did try to sell themselves, but were not super pushy.",,,"I did not look very closely to rally, but I went on their site and tried to get some idea about their product. Impression that I got -- it is powerful, but not streamlined, looks like it is created as alternative to Jira.  It has a learning curve, the project is rich but not intuitive. So  with chronic lack of time it would require me a very important reason to study Rally, and figure out their ways.  However it is designed for large teams, and may be someone will find it exciting and learn about it more."pivotal,Dima,yes,"yes, see http://www.pivotaltracker.com/community/tracker-blog/guide-githubs-service-hook-tracker",,"yes, see http://www.pivotaltracker.com/community/tracker-blog/wonders-workspaces",,"Pivotal Tracker is one of the first decent Agile tools.  Pros* 'Kanban' board from the day one. It is quite intuitive and much more powerful than Waffle/ZenHub* A lot of powerful agile tools -- automatic calculation of all important statistics, flexible tracking of velocity. Much more mature from Agile standpoint than Waffle of ZenHubCons* It is so Agile that sometimes it feels uncomfortable when there is a need to do things differently* Iterations are not very flexible, it is cumbersome to change size on iteration, or date of iteration.I would take a very close look at Pivotal tracker. The workflow is streamlined, support for multiple project integration is good, GitHub integration is there, and quality of the project is higher than either waffle or zenhub (both have much more bugs and much less functionality)"trello,Arlin,yes,"via Zapier, which links apps using triggers. The problem is possibly that the zaps only run every 15 minutes, so we won't have immediate updates as in waffle","trello is free,  but Zapier is only free for up to 5 zaps and 100 events per month.
