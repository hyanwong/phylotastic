# Phylotastic hackathon plan

## possible locations 

* TN - central  
* NM - more team members on-site
* MD - too expensive? 
* UIUC - central
* Ann Arbor - get OT people involved

## budget

we put in a budget for this.  part of that includes salary for IBBR support staff to do the reimbursements. 

## general plan 

* NESCent hackathon
* 4 or 5 days
* 25 people plus locals
* but allow more teams than usual NESCent hackathon? 

## scoping and example targets

subject: Call for applications to participate in a Phylotastic hackathon (<location> on <date>)

The aim of the Phylotastic project is to foster a sustainable ecosystem of web services that can be leveraged to provide convenient access to the tree of life and to related knowledge of characters, taxonomy, and biodiversity.  The current Phylotastic portal illustrates on-the-fly delivery of species trees based on available web services that recognize scientific names, harvest images and other data, extract topologies from available supertrees, scale them by time or character divergence, and render them graphically.  Further applications could be built using the available set of over 20 web services-- for reconciling names, getting trees, finding images or common names, and so on--, along with toolbox code in R and Python for executing Phylotastic workflows.  

The purpose of the hackathon is to stimulate further developments that add to this system or leverage it to support research, education, or public appreciation of science.  The targets of the hackathon are not determined in advance: projects and teams will emerge in a bottom-up participatory process.  Examples of suitable projects would be to embed Phylotastic functionality into existing tools (e.g., tree-viewers, apps of any kind that generate or use taxon lists), to build new clients (e.g., phylogeny-learning games, tools to populate EOL taxon pages with trees), to develop classroom exercises, and so on.  We  welcome big-picture ideas like developing a system to gather, cross-map and disseminate phyloreferences, or using available resources to evaluate robustness and coverage of OpenTree's resources.  

Whether you are a researcher, a curator, an educator, or something else, we encourage you to apply for participation, which will include travel support for most participants.  The application calls for brief statements of your ideas, your skills and your domain knowledge.  Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.
