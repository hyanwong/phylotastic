# Phylotastic hackathon plan

## location

We chose TN from among the following
* TN - NIMBioS support; central location
* NM - more team members on-site
* MD - too expensive? 
* UIUC - central
* Ann Arbor - get OT people involved

## budget

We put in a budget for this.  This is in the NMSU budget. 

## general plan 

* NESCent hackathon [ENRICO: why NESCent?]
* 4 or 5 days
* 25 people plus locals
* but allow more teams than usual NESCent hackathon? [ENRICO: are we allowing remote participants as we did in some of the others?]

## logistics

* NIMBioS
* 8 to 11 of August, 2017
* will overlap with RevBayes workshop

## email announcement: open call for participation

subject: Call for applications to participate in the Phylotastic "Trees to go" hackathon (August 8 to 11, 2017, NIMBioS in Knoxville, TN)

We invite interested scientists, programmers and educators to a 4-day hackathon centered on leveraging resources of the Phylotastic project, including its graphical web portal, its over 20 web services, and its toolbox code in R, Python and Ruby.  

The aim of the Phylotastic project is to foster a sustainable ecosystem of web services that together provide access to and use of the tree of life and related knowledge of taxonomy, characters, and biodiversity.  The system includes over 20 web services for operations such as reconciling names, managing lists of taxa, getting trees, finding images, and so on.  Workflows based on these services can be invoked with toolbox code in R, Python and Ruby.  The Phylotastic web portal illustrates on-the-fly delivery of species trees based on web services that extract taxon names from electronic sources, find topologies from available supertrees, scale them by time, harvest images and other data, and render the results graphically.  This tool is suitable for use in developing lesson plans about phylogeny for students from middle school and higher.  

The purpose of the hackathon is to stimulate further developments that add to this system or leverage it to support research, education, or public appreciation of science.  The targets of the hackathon are not determined in advance: projects and teams will emerge in a bottom-up participatory process.  Examples of suitable projects would be to embed Phylotastic functionality into existing tools (e.g., tree-viewers, apps of any kind that generate or use taxon lists), to build new clients (e.g., phylogeny-learning games, tools to populate EOL taxon pages with trees), to develop classroom exercises, and so on.  We welcome big-picture ideas like developing a system to gather, cross-map and disseminate phyloreferences, or using available tools to evaluate robustness and coverage of OpenTree's resources. 

Whether you are a researcher, a curator, an educator, or something else, we encourage you to apply for participation, which will include travel support for most participants.  The application calls for brief statements of your ideas, your skills and your domain knowledge.  Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply. 

We encourage pre-application questions, which may be directed to . . .
