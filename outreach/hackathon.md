# Phylotastic hackathon plan

## location

We chose TN from among the following
* TN - NIMBioS support; central location
* NM - more team members on-site
* MD - too expensive? 
* UIUC - central
* Ann Arbor - get OT people involved

## budget

We put in a budget for this.  This is in the NMSU budget. 

## general plan 

* NESCent hackathon [ENRICO: why NESCent?]
* 4 or 5 days
* 25 people plus locals
* but allow more teams than usual NESCent hackathon? [ENRICO: are we allowing remote participants as we did in some of the others?]

## scoping and example targets

subject: Call for applications to participate in a Phylotastic hackathon (<location> on <date>)

The aim of the Phylotastic project is to foster a sustainable ecosystem of web services that together provide access to and use of the tree of life and related knowledge of taxonomy, characters, and biodiversity.  The system currently consists of over 20 web services for operations such as reconciling names, managing lists of taxa, getting trees, finding images or common names, and so on.  Workflows based on these services can be invoked conveniently with toolbox code in R and Python.  The Phylotastic web portal illustrates on-the-fly delivery of species trees based on web services that extract taxon names from electronic sources, find topologies from available supertrees, scale them by time or character divergence, harvest images and other data, and render the results graphically.  

The purpose of the hackathon is to stimulate further developments that add to this system or leverage it to support research, education, or public appreciation of science.  The targets of the hackathon are not determined in advance: projects and teams will emerge in a bottom-up participatory process.  Examples of suitable projects would be to embed Phylotastic functionality into existing tools (e.g., tree-viewers, apps of any kind that generate or use taxon lists), to build new clients (e.g., phylogeny-learning games, tools to populate EOL taxon pages with trees), to develop classroom exercises, and so on.  We  also would welcome big-picture ideas like developing a system to gather, cross-map and disseminate phyloreferences, or using available resources to evaluate robustness and coverage of OpenTree's resources. 

Whether you are a researcher, a curator, an educator, or something else, we encourage you to apply for participation, which will include travel support for most participants.  The application calls for brief statements of your ideas, your skills and your domain knowledge.  Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.
