# Outreach goals and strategy 

## Vision

The Phylotastic project establishes a central role in the community of practice focused on the challenge of disseminating tree-of-life knowledge.  We establish ties to related projects and offer helpful feedback.  We pursue mutually beneficial collaborations.  We are the go-to resource for disseminating phylogenetic knowledge.
