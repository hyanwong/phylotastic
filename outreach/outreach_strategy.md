# Outreach goals and strategy 

## Vision

Scientists, educators and the general public see the Phylotastic project as the go-to resource for getting expert knowledge of species relationships. We play a central role in the community of practice focused on the challenge of disseminating tree-of-life knowledge.  We establish ties to related projects and offer helpful feedback.  We pursue mutually beneficial collaborations with scientists, educators and museum staff.   

## Goals 

Some things we want to accomplish by reaching out:
* thousands of scientists and educators are aware of our tools 
* tens of thousands have seen or used trees delivered phylotastically
* potential collaborators are aware of our project 
   * academic collaborators 
   * educators
   * zoo and museum outreach coordinator
* we have enough community buy-in to ensure that we get responses when we ask for feedback or participation

## Outreach strategies 

### Open science 
* We maintain a public chat room for project communications.   
* We welcome visitors and engage with them 
* Code is open-source
* Development model is open and well documented
* Provide usable/accessible portals

### Communications of news and achievements
* Scientific publications
   * Publish a software paper for every tool.  Some ideas: 
      * Generalized Web UI with underlying web-services architecture
      * Automated planning and execution of workflows to extract phylogenetic knowledge
      * MySafari: Capture and mashup species names at any zoo or museum
   * Publish in the educational literature
      * Teaching about biodiversity with online phylogenetics tools
   * Actively pursue chances to publish scientific side-projects
      * analyses of high-value datasets 
      * evaluations of OpenTree content
      * evaluations of name processing
* Informal communications
   * blogs on related web sites 
* Social media 
   * twitter 

### Collaboration 
* educator consultants 
   * high school
   * university
* research consultants 
* museum consultants 

### Training materials, workshops, hackathons
* presentations at conferences 
* special workshops 
   * workshop on APIs
   * focused groups on targeted applications of Phylotastic (e.g., centered around one use case)
* year 3 hackathon 

### Community testing and RFCs 
* broadcast requests for comment on APIs
* develop small community of user-testers
