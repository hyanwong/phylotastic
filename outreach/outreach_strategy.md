# Outreach goals and strategy 

## Vision

Scientists, educators and the general public see the Phylotastic project as the go-to resource for getting expert knowledge of species relationships. We play a central role in the community of practice focused on the challenge of disseminating tree-of-life knowledge.  We establish ties to related projects and offer helpful feedback.  We pursue mutually beneficial collaborations with scientists, educators and museum staff.   

## Goals 

This project aims to develop useful tools that will disseminate phylogenetic knowledge, lowering barriers and generally making the ToL more accessible to researchers, educators, and the general public. In order to succeed, it is important for people other than project staff to be involved in (1) providing feedback on tools and ideas and (2) actually using the services both for testing and for practical purposes.  Achieving a high level of success will also involve cooperation with other projects.  

Success in outreach means that we can
* obtain feedback from 10s of formal or informal consultants each quarter, as needed
* attract attention to our tools from 1000s of scientists and educators 
* disseminate phylotastic trees to 10,000s
* attract interest from potential collaborators 
   * academic collaborators 
   * educators
   * zoo and museum outreach coordinator
* build a user base of 100s that use the system at least quarterly

## Outreach strategies 

### Open science 
* We maintain a public chat room for project communications.   
* We welcome visitors and engage with them 
* Code is open-source
* Development model is open and well documented
* We provide a useable and accessible portal

### Project announcements and recruitment 
* We advertise widely when 
   * a position in the project becomes open
   * a new tool or major version is released 
   * we want feedback on proposed plans or changes

### Communications of news and achievements
* Informal communications
   * blogs on related web sites 
* Social media 
   * twitter 
   * news feed

### Collaboration 
* Pursue collaborations as opportunities arise 
* Pursue collaborations for a specified target 
* Develop relationships with consultants and testers
   * educators 
   * researchers 
   * curators 

### Training materials, workshops, hackathons
* presentations at conferences 
* special workshops 
   * workshop on APIs
   * focused groups on targeted applications of Phylotastic (single use case)
* year 3 hackathon 

### Scientific publications
* Publish a software paper for every tool.  Some ideas: 
   * Generalized Web UI with underlying web-services architecture
   * Automated planning and execution of workflows to extract phylogenetic knowledge
   * MySafari: Capture and mashup species names at any zoo or museum
* Publish in the educational literature
   * Teaching about biodiversity with online phylogenetics tools
* Actively pursue chances to publish scientific side-projects
   * analyses of high-value datasets 
   * evaluations of OpenTree content
   * evaluations of name processing
