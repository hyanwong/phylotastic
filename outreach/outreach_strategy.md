# Outreach goals and strategy 

## Vision

Scientists, educators and the general public see the Phylotastic project as the go-to resource for getting expert knowledge of species relationships. The project establishes a central role in the community of practice focused on the challenge of disseminating tree-of-life knowledge.  We establish ties to related projects and offer helpful feedback.  We pursue mutually beneficial collaborations.   

## Goals 

Some things we want to accomplish by reaching out:
* thousands of scientists and educators are aware of our tools 
* tens of thousands have seen or used trees delivered phylotastically
* potential collaborators are aware of our project 
   * academic collaborators 
   * educators
   * zoo and museum outreach coordinator
* we have enough community buy-in to ensure that we get responses when we ask for feedback or alpha testers

## Outreach strategies 

### Open science 
* We maintain a public chat room for project communications.   
* We welcome visitors and engage with them 
* Code is open-source
* Development model is open

### Communications of news and achievements
* Scientific publications
   * Publish a paper with every tool
   * Actively pursue chances to publish work from side-projects
* Informal communications
   * blogs on related web sites 
* Social media 
   * twitter 

### Collaboration 
* educator consultants 
* research consultants 
* museum consultants 

### Training materials and workshops 
* presentations at conferences 
* special workshops 
* 

### Community testing and RFCs 
* broadcast requests for comment on APIs
* develop small community of user-testers
