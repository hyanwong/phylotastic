# Mobile App Tester Instructions 

The Phylotastic Trees-to-Go app allows you to (1) take a photo of a sign (e.g., museum, zoo, hallway poster), (2) find any scientific name by OCR (Optical character recognition), adding them to a list, (3) repeat the two previous steps to build up a list, and (4) get a tree for the list from OpenTree.  Multiple lists can be maintained. 

## What we are asking of you 

This is an initial clumsy implementation.  Tree-viewing is poor, but the ability to capture names from signage is quite good.  Our goal is to find out whether anyone would find this useful, so that we can decide whether to continue development, and in what direction.  

We encourage you to be open-minded about using this.  One of our team members captured 266 names from a photo of a printed page of genera (~12-pt font) taped to a wall. 

## How to install 

You will receive an invitation from Apple to install TestFlight, which allows us to distribute our app to selected users. Updates will be done through TestFlight. 

## How to give feedback 

Help us to stay focused on the big picture-- what we need most is to know who would use this app?  How would they use it?  What features would enhance its power and useability?   

You can email us, but we prefer to get feedback via GitHub issues, so that your bug report or feature request goes right into our development workflow.  

1. Go to the "issues" page at https://github.com/phylotastic/Phylotastic_Mobile_Application/issues

2. Search to see if the issue has been posted already (add terms to the "Filters" box at left and click "Filters").  
* if the issue already exists, add clarifying comments, or just a "+1"
* if the issue doesn't exist, click the green "New Issue" button at right

Even if the issue exists already, say something!  This helps us to know what's important.  

For bugs, describe it to us like we're small children, one small step at a time-- tell us exactly what the app does, and why it's wrong. 

For new features, tell us what you want to accomplish, and why. What is the start, and what is the end?  

## Tips and tricks 

* The swipe-to-delete feature works but doesn't depict the swiping graphically.  You'll know it worked when you get an alert box asking if you want to delete a name.

* If you want to look at your tree outside the app, or share it with someone, go to the tree view (Home --> List --> Get Tree), select "Export", then "View in Browser".  This sends the tree (inside a URL) to a display service.  You can then use whatever sharing capabilities your browser has.  In iOS, this means you can press one button to share via Text, Mail, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc.
