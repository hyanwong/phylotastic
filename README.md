# phylotastic core 

Core functionalities for a production version of the Phylotastic system. 

## about 

"Phylotastic" refers to a community-based system for delivering phylogenetic knowledge via web services composition.  Individual web services provide taxonomy resolutions, source trees, pruning operations, calibrations, and so on.  Clients of the system combine these services to provide species trees to users.  The idea emerged from NESCent's HIP (Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenies) working group, and was prototyped at a NESCent-sponsored hackathon in 2012, as described by [Stoltzfus et al, 2013](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/158). 

The main web page at [www.phylotastic.org](http://www.phylotastic.org) provides demonstrations (screencasts, live software) and further information.  

As of 2015, NSF has funded a project to develop a production version of the system.  This is the main repository for the core functionality.
