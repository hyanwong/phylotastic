# phylotastic project

This repo is the administrative home for the Phylotastic project and the Phylotastic github organization. 

## about

"Phylotastic" refers to a community-based system for delivering phylogenetic knowledge via web services composition.  Individual web services provide taxonomy resolutions, source trees, pruning operations, calibrations, and so on.  Clients of the system combine these services to provide species trees to users.  The idea emerged from NESCent's HIP (Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenies) working group, and was prototyped at a NESCent-sponsored hackathon in 2012, as described by [Stoltzfus et al, 2013][phylotastic-ref].

The main web page at [www.phylotastic.org][phylotastic-web] provides demonstrations (screencasts, live software) and further information.

As of 2015, NSF has funded a project to develop a production version of the system.  This is the main repository for the core functionality.

## code repositories

The active code repositories are in the github phylotastic organization.  Stale repositories (mostly from hackathons) are in the phylotastic-legacy organization.
